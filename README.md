# A TiddlyWiki plugin for finding and highlighting text

Go to https://janttt.github.io/tiddlywiki.highlight for details and installation.

WARNING:

The current (beta) version regresses: higlighting is no longer removed.

It also contains a bug whereby the buttons work on outdated data after a reset or a change in the river story.
This may lead to a "red screen of death" with a JavaScript error. 

A new version will be published shortly.
